                <p class="text-primary">
                    The School of Advanced Sciences, <strong class="text-bold-black">Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), Chennai</strong>, in collaboration with the <strong class="text-bold-black">Department of Applied Mathematics, Vidyasagar University</strong>, is pleased to organize the <strong class="text-bold-black">International Conference on Graph Theory and Fuzzy Graphs (ICGTFG 2026)</strong> to commemorate the <strong class="text-bold-black">50th Anniversary of Fuzzy Graph Theory (1975–2025)</strong>. The conference will be coordinated by the <strong class="text-bold-black">Sridhracharya Academy of Mathematical Sciences (SAAMS)</strong>.
                </p>
                <p class="text-primary">
                    Graph theory, a fundamental branch of Mathematics, has extensive applications across diverse areas of science and technology, including computer networks, communication systems, biological modeling, and social network analysis. After the introduction of Fuzzy logic by Lotfi A. Zadeh in 1965, it was also applied to graph theory, to model real-world problems more sensibly. Since the inception of Fuzzy graphs in 1975, this field has evolved rapidly, offering powerful tools to model uncertainty and complexity in real-world systems.
                </p>
                <p class="text-primary">
                    The conference aims to bring together eminent academicians, researchers, and professionals from across the globe to exchange ideas and present recent advancements in Graph theory, Fuzzy set theory, Fuzzy graphs, and their interdisciplinary applications. It will feature keynote lectures, invited talks, technical sessions, and discussions focused on theoretical developments and practical implementations in areas such as optimization, artificial intelligence, data science, and decision-making.
                </p>
                <p class="text-primary">
                    The conference will be held at <strong class="text-bold-black">VIT Chennai Campus</strong>, providing an excellent platform for collaboration, innovation, and the advancement of Mathematical sciences.
